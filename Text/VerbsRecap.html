    Analyzing and looking up verb forms
  </h2>

	<p class="linguisticNote">
    <br/>
    Let's start with these two verb forms:
    <br/>
  </p>
    <ul class="dottedList">
      <li><b>τεῦχε</b> (from the sentence αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν /
      οἰωνοῖσί τε δαῖτα)</li>
      <li><b>καθεῦδε</b> (from the sentence ὣς ὁ μὲν ἔνθα καθεῦδε)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="linguisticNote">
    <br/>
    Here is a summary table for the primary and secondary endings
    (cf. <em>Ancient Greek for Everyone</em>, <a href="https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/28/">ch. 28</a>):
    </p/><br/>
    <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter size-full wp-image-1249">
    <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1249" src="/greek102web/Images/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings.png" alt=""  style="max-width:100%" srcset="/greek102web/Images/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings.png 1314w, /greek102web/Images/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings-300x214.png 300w, /greek102web/Images/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings-768x549.png 768w, https://pressbooks.com/app/uploads/sites/48881/2017/03/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings-1024x732.png 1024w, https://pressbooks.com/app/uploads/sites/48881/2017/03/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings-65x46.png 65w, https://pressbooks.com/app/uploads/sites/48881/2017/03/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings-225x161.png 225w, https://pressbooks.com/app/uploads/sites/48881/2017/03/Master-List-of-Verb-Endings-350x250.png 350w"/>
    </div>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      The above primary endings also apply to all the tenses of the subjunctive, and the secondary endings apply to all the tenses of the optative.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
    So <span class="case">-ε</span> is the ending of the 3rd pers sg act, for past tenses of -ω Verbs. For -μι verbs, there is no distinct ending,
    -ε corresponding to the thematic vowel.
    <br/>
    So from the <span class="case">-ε</span> ending we know it's
    a 3^ sg in an active past tense: aorist, imperfect, pluperfect
    in the indicative, or in the optative (all the optative
    tenses use the secondary past endings, for present, furure,
    aorist, perfect).
    <br/>
    We could already suppose both τεῦχε and καθεῦδε might be imperferct
    tenses because there is not <span class="case">–σ–</span> a the end
    of the stem, which is found in some aorist and future forms, and it
    does not have the reduplication of the perfect, or of some older forms of the aorist.
    Also we can rule out the optative because both τεῦχε and καθεῦδε lack
    the characteristic <span class="case">–ι–</span> or
    <span class="case">–ιη-</span> optative suffix between the stem
    and the endings.
    <br/>
    Looking up in the dictionary (Montanari's one, for example), we find
    the entry τεύχω (present ind act 1sg), for which the imperfect is listed
    as ἔτευχον (and in the epic form without augment: τεῦχον), and
    the aorist as ἔτευξα.
    From this we conclude that the form τεῦχε is using the present
    stem, with a past ending, so it must be in the imperfect tense.
    So it's an imperfect indicative active in the 3rd pers. sg,
    in an epic-homeric form withtou augment, with meaning "it made"
    (the subject is Achilles' wrath, which made the corpses of the heroes
    into prey for dogs and feast for crows).
    <br/>
    For <b>καθεῦδε</b>, the same reasoning applies, it most likely
    seems to be an imperfect (no <span class="case">–σ–</span>
    and no reduplication).
    In the dictionary we find καθεύδω (ion. κατεύδω), with
    impf. καθεῦδον (o καθῆυδον) / ἐκάθευδον.
    The dictionary does not list the other paradigm forms.
    It derives from κατά + εὕδω. <b>εὕδω</b> (impf. ηὗδον, aor. ηὕδησα)
    "to sleep", is generally used in composites.
    Other forms:  impf. εὗδον, iter. εὕδεσκον ‖ att. gener. καθεύδω.
    So we conclude that καθεῦδε is indeed a form of the imperfect active
    in the 3rd pers sg, meaning "he was sleeping down".
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      Let's see two  more verb forms in the imperfect tense, but in the middle or passive voice:
    </p>
    <ul class="dottedList">
      <li><b>ἐτελείετο</b> (from the sentence Διὸς δ᾽ ἐτελείετο βουλή)</li>
      <li><b>ἔφατο</b> (from the sentence ὣς ἔφατ᾽)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      From the endings table, we see that <span class="case">–το</span> is the ending for the 3rd pers sg middle or passive for past tenses.
      So this again might be either an imperfect, aorist, or pluperfet.
      <br/>We see that both start with the augment <span class="case">–ἐ</span>, so for ἐτελείετο we look up in the dictionary for a present  starting with τελε–. For the verb <b>τελέω</b>, we find that in homeric Greek has the form ἐτελείετο for the 3^ pers. sg middle-passive voice. So ἐτελείετο means "it was being fulfilled".
    </p>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      For <b>ἔφατο</b> the search might not be so straightforward because the present stem seems not derivable from this form (by removing the augment <span class="case">–ἐ</span>, and the personal ending <span class="case">–το</span>, we would look for a verb starting with <b>φα–</b> in the present). But this is one of the most frequently used verbs (φημί, "to say", in position n. 41 in Dickinson College's <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/greek-core-list">Greek Core Vocabulary</a>), with a limited paradigm and an imperfect middle 1st pers sg in ἐφάμην.
    </p>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      <br/>
      Let's see three  more verb forms:
    </p>
    <ul class="dottedList">
      <li><b>ἔγροιτο</b> (from the sentence ὡς Ὀδυσεὺς ἔγροιτο, ἴδοι τ᾽ ἐυώπιδα κούρην)</li>
      <li><b>ἔθηκεν</b> (from the sentence ἣ μυρί᾽ Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε᾽ ἔθηκεν)</li>
      <li><b>προΐαψεν</b> (from the sentence Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      <br/>
      <b>ἔγροιτο</b> is a 3rd pers sg middle-passive, in a past tense, or optative. The <span class="case">–ι</span> suffix indicates it's an optative.<br/>
      The present form (
      <span data-audio-file="Forvo/ἐγείρω_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἐγείρω</b></span>
      <span><img class="inlineiconnp" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
      "to wake up"), is not straightforward to find in the dictionary with the rules seen so far here. The initial <span class="case">ἔ–</span> is not an augment, and the vowel change in the stem, from –γείρ– to –γρ– does not follow the typical apophony rules (Smyth 1920, <a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm">§ 27-59</a>), according to which the additional –ι– is preserved at the zero degree in the aorist. <br/>
      According to Chantraine (1968, <a href="https://archive.org/details/Dictionnaire-Etymologique-Grec/page/n323/mode/2up">p.310</a>), the initial <span class="case">ἔ–</span> might be either a prothetic vowel (Smyth 1920, <a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_1b_uni.htm">§ 41</a>), or the remains of an aorist with reduplication (Smyth 1920, <a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2Vp_uni.htm">§§ 439-448</a>, AGE <a href="https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/6/">ch. 6</a> and <a href="https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/42/">42</a>). In any case, the present ἐγείρω has been created from the aorist ἔγρετο.
    </p>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      <br/>
      <b>ἔθηκεν</b> is a 3rd pers sg active of a past tense. This is a very common verb, τίθημι ("to put, place; establish; put in a certain state; cause"), n. 164 in Dickinson College's <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/greek-core-list">Greek Core Vocabulary</a>. The present has reduplication. The aorist 1sg active is ἔθηκα (this is one of those aorists formed with <span class="case">–κα</span> instead of <span class="case">–σα</span>, see AGE <a href="https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/32/">ch. 32</a>). So the meaning of ἔθηκεν is "it caused".
    </p>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      <br/>
      <b>προΐαψεν</b> is again a 3rd pers sg active of a past tense. It seems to be a sigmatic aorist because the stem ends with <span class="case">–πσ–</span>.
      Looking for προΐα– in the dictionary we find <b>προϊάπτω</b> ("to throw in front"), with aorist προΐαψα. So the meaning is "it threw".
    </p>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      <br/>
      Let's see two  more verb forms:
    </p>
    <ul class="dottedList">
      <li><b>ἀντέγραψαν</b> (from the sentence ἀντέγραψαν ‘αἴκα.’)</li>
      <li><b>γράψαντος</b> (from the sentence γράψαντος αὐτοῖς τοῦ Φιλίππου)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      <br/>
      <b>ἀντέγραψαν</b> ends with <span class="case">–σαν</span>, so it must be a 3rd pers pl active, of a past tense of a –μι verb.
      <br/>We can recognize that it is a composite of the prefix
      ἀντ– (from
      <span data-audio-file="Forvo/ἀντὶ_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)">ἀντί</span>
      <span><img class="inlineiconnp" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>)
      + έγραψαν. έγραψαν seems an augmented form, so if we loot for ἀντίγρα– (withouth the augment), we find the verb ἀντιγράφω ("to write back"), derivative of
      <span data-audio-file="Forvo/γράφω_(anthian9).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)">γράφω,</span>
      <span><img class="inlineiconnp" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>
      which has aorist
      <span data-audio-file="Forvo/ἔγραψα_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)">έγραψα</span>
      <span><img class="inlineiconnp" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span> (so ἀντέγραψαν is using the supposed typical endings of –μι verbs, even though it is a –ω verb).
      <br/>So ἀντέγραψαν means "they wrote back".
    </p>
    <p class="linguisticNote">
      <br/>
      <b>γράψαντος</b> has the <span class="case">–ντ</span> suffix, so it is a participle active.
      <br/>We have to determine if γράψα– is a stem of the present, future or aorist (participles use the stems of the indicative mood, cf. <em>Ancient Greek for Everyone</em>, <a href="https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/37/ ">ch. 37</a>), and to which gender, number and case corresponds the <span class="case">–ος</span> ending.
      <br/>γράψα– is most likely the base of an aorist active participle, because it ends with –σα (while the future would end with just –σ and the present with just the present stem, cf. <em>Ancient Greek for Everyone</em>, <a href="https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/38/ ">ch. 38</a>).
      <br/>The <span class="case">–ος</span> ending is that of the genitive singular, masculine or neuter (cf Smyth 1920, <a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2j_uni.htm">§§ 305-310</a>).
      <br/>Therefore γράψαντος is an aorist particle active in the genitive singular. Since in the sentence it is paired with a noun also in the genitive (τοῦ Φιλίππου), it is a genitive absolute (cf. <em>Ancient Greek for Everyone</em>, <a href="https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/39/ ">ch. 39</a>), meaning "when Philip wrote".
